This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

My first Hello world of R

```{r}
# Print Hello World.
print("Hello World")
# Add two numbers.
print(23.9 + 11.6)

```
add 3D Charts

```{r}
install("plotrix")
```
Start New Lines of code
```{r}
myString <- "Hello, World!"
print ( myString)

```

To Run this code from terminal Rscript test.R"

A trick to print multi lines
```{r}
if(FALSE){
 "This is a demo for multi-line comments and it should be put
 inside either a single of double quote"
}
myString <- "Hello, World!"
print ( myString)

```

Detect Data type

```{r}
v <- TRUE
print(v)
print(class(v))
print("")
v <- 23.5
print(v)
print(class(v))
print("")
v <- 2L
print(v)
print(class(v))
print("")
v <- 2+5i
print(v)
print(class(v))
print("")
v <- "TRUE"
print(v)
print(class(v))
print("")
v <- charToRaw("Hello")
print(v)
print(class(v))


```
Data structures
* Vector
* List
* Matrices
* Arrays
* Factors
* Data Frames
```{r}
print("")
# Create a vector.
apple <- c('red','green',"yellow")
print(apple)
# Get the class of the vector.
print(class(apple))
print("")
# Create a list.
list1 <- list(c(2,5,3),21.3,sin)
# Print the list.
print(class(list1))
print(list1)
print("")
# Create a matrix.
M = matrix( c('a','a','b','c','b','a'), nrow=2,ncol=3,byrow = TRUE)
print(class(M))
print(M)
print("")
# Create an array.
a <- array(c('green','yellow'),dim=c(3,3,2))
print(class(a))
print(a)
print("")
# Create a vector.
apple_colors <- c('green','green','yellow','red','red','red','green')
# Create a factor object.
factor_apple <- factor(apple_colors)
# Print the factor.
print(class(factor_apple))
print(factor_apple)
print(nlevels(factor_apple))
print("")
# Create the data frame.
BMI <- data.frame(
gender = c("Male", "Male","Female"),
height = c(152, 171.5, 165),
weight = c(81,93, 78),
Age =c(42,38,26)
)
print(class(BMI))
print(BMI)
print("")
```
Variable Assignment
* Assignment using equal operator.
* Assignment using leftward operator.
* Assignment using rightward operator.
```{r}
# Assignment using equal operator.
var.1 = c(0,1,2,3)
# Assignment using leftward operator.
var.2 <- c("learn","R")
# Assignment using rightward operator.
c(TRUE,1) -> var.3 

print(var.1)
cat ("var.1 is ", var.1 ,"\n")
cat ("var.2 is ", var.2 ,"\n")
cat ("var.3 is ", var.3 ,"\n")
```
Data Type of a Variable
```{r}
var_x <- "Hello"
cat("The class of var_x is ",class(var_x),"\n")
var_x <- 34.5
cat("Now the class of var_x is ",class(var_x),"\n")
var_x <- 27L
cat("Next the class of var_x becomes ",class(var_x),"\n")
```
Finding Variables
* traditional way
* List the variables starting with the pattern "var".
* get hidden variable
```{r}
print(ls())
# List the variables starting with the pattern "var".
print(ls(pattern="var")) 
#get hidden variable
print(ls(all.name=TRUE))

```
Deleting Variables
* Delete a specific variable
* Delete a list of variables
```{r}
#Delete a specific variable
rm(var.3)
print(var.3)
#Delete a list of variables
rm(list=ls())
print(ls())
```
